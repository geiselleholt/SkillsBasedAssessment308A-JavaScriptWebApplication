### Back at it again with another cool project for my Per Scholas bootcamp! The topic for this week's Skills Based Assessment was JavaScript Web Application 😎

### Our learning objectives were:

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

### I used 2 Game Of Thrones APIs to create a fun quiz game to test your GOT memory. I'll give you a quote and 6 options of who could have said such a thing. If you get it correct you're awarded with an alert. If you get it wrong you get an alert and you get to try again.

### As per usual we had 2 days to complete this SBA. If given more time I would have:

- Error handling
- Developed a points system to keep track of rights and wrongs
- Have a timer to see how many you can get in 2 min. Display the high score
- Or see how many you can get without getting one wrong. Display the high score
- Or make the wrong images disappear one by one every 5 seconds
- Make confetti rain down when you get a correct answer
